This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Running This Application

1. Clone the app to a local repository
2. Start up `cd ~/your-local-repo && npm i && npm start`

This will build and start the application (you can run in a full build via `npm run-build` and following the serve instructions if necessary). From there the application can be read / interacted with.
